= Haitian Voices - http://haitianvoices.org

The Haitian community has requested that CrisisCommons create a capacity for survivors to tell their story of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. They would like to post information for survivor stories, saying thank you to the world. A construct where there would be a "wall" feature where people can go and post survivor stories. They would want to filter so that the open space is not abused. There has been an outpouring of all the communities in the world. They have been hearing so many stories. The community believes its important to capture these stories now as it is" a defining moment in our history." This would be called "Haitian Voices".

Please use unique prefixes (like namespaces) to prevent conflicts between views.
